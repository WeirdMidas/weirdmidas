## Hi there 👋 I'm Weird Midas, a strange "Midas" that doesn't turn anything into gold on the first touch

My name is The Weird Midas and my real name is **Davi Arthur da Silva**, many friends and even my boyfriend consider me self-taught because of my ability to learn without anyone teaching me, which is how I learned to create modules like my **SkyScene**, **LmkdOPT**, **Basic Cleaner** and my projects that I'm most focused on at the moment: **Perfd-opt** & **Uperf-Ish**

### 🫠 About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Forks of old projects with the intention of making them better for current Android needs
- 🌱 I am currently learning about the EAS scheduler and its methods for selecting the best core for energy saving
- 👽 Who am I? I'm a 1.80m tall colored cat of the "Puss in Boots" species, I have black and white eyes that look like precious stones... Hahaha, at least that's how I identify myself on the internet
- 👣 Where am I from? I'm Brazilian, I'm poor and I spend my time taking care of my boyfriend, and creating magisk modules to complement android features that I feel can be improved
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, I'm gay and I have a boyfriend
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like Pokemon, I'm addicted to Pokemon Crystal Clear and the Minecraft Cubblemon mod and my favorite Pokemons are Meowscarada and Garchomp
