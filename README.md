## Hi there 👋 I'm Weird Midas, a strange "Midas"

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Forks of old projects with the intention of making them better for current Android needs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to master android ram management
- 👽 Who am I? I'm a 1.80m tall colored cat of the "Puss in Boots" species, I have black and white eyes that look like precious stones... Hahaha, at least that's how I identify myself on the internet
- 👣 Where am I from? I'm Brazilian, I'm poor and I spend my time taking care of my boyfriend, and creating magisk modules to complement android features that I feel can be improved
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, I'm gay and I have a boyfriend
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like Pokemon, I'm addicted to Pokemon Crystal Clear and the Minecraft Cubblemon mod and my favorite Pokemons are Meowscarada and Garchomp

# Due to personal problems and with some devs, I will have to stay out of the loop, sorry to those who liked my modules, but it got to a point where I was torturing myself to try to create something good, and no one tried to help me.
