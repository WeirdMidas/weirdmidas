## Hi there 👋 I'm Weird Midas, a strange "Midas"

My name is The Weird Midas and my real name is **Davi Arthur da Silva**, many friends and even my boyfriend consider me self-taught because of my ability to learn without anyone teaching me, which is how I learned to create modules like my **SkyScene**, **Atlas** and **UperfCapacity**.

# 🫠 About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Forks of old projects with the intention of making them better for current Android needs
- 🌱 I am currently trying to learn to master the EAS/HMP scheduler and master the memory management of Android devices
- 👽 Who am I? I'm a 1.80m tall colored cat of the "Puss in Boots" species, I have black and white eyes that look like precious stones... Hahaha, at least that's how I identify myself on the internet
- 👣 Where am I from? I'm Brazilian, I'm poor and I spend my time taking care of my boyfriend, and creating magisk modules to complement android features that I feel can be improved
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, I'm gay and I have a boyfriend
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like Pokemon, I'm addicted to Pokemon Crystal Clear and the Minecraft Cubblemon mod and my favorite Pokemons are Meowscarada and Garchomp
- 🥰 For those worried, I'm getting better. Even though my parents are in a mess because they're about to undergo a Venezuelan-style dictatorship, I'm also improving in other areas like mentality and health. I've finally managed to move forward with my projects, yeeeey
  
### My career on github
[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=weirdmidas)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

### My main projects currently 🥱
- 🐦 [SkyScene](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/SkyScene-Addon) - A memory management module that aims to be modern and extract the maximum from lowmem (4GB or less) and high perf (6GB or more) devices. Pushing the limits of multitasking and energy efficiency at the same time.
- 🐣 [Capacity-Userspace Superset Scheduler](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/UperfCapacity) - An evolution of the Uperf scheduler, this approach transcends the simplicity of performance control to focus on the essence of fluidity. With granular, user-space-focused control, this project is a new way to integrate dynamic and intelligent CASS (Capacity-Aware Superset Scheduler) behavior. Specializing in single- and multi-core performance, cache locality, and energy efficiency, CASS simplifies core selection based on demand and need, taking consistency and energy savings to a new level. Furthermore, this approach includes EAS details such as efficiency, a power model for energy-aware decision-making, and more.
- 🌐 [Atlas](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/Atlas) - If you want to try a CPU, I/O, and GPU optimization module if you don't find compatibility in UperfCapacity, try Atlas! A modern version of Tytydraco's Ktweak that's more beneficial for Android Dynamic Workloads, it doesn't focus on absolute latency, but rather on an intelligent and respectful balance with user capabilities.
