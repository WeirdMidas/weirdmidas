## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Weird Midas, a strange "Midas"

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Forks of old projects with the intention of making them better for current Android needs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to master android ram management
- ðŸ‘½ Who am I? I'm a 1.80m tall colored cat of the "Puss in Boots" species, I have black and white eyes that look like precious stones... Hahaha, at least that's how I identify myself on the internet
- ðŸ‘£ Where am I from? I'm Brazilian, I'm poor and I spend my time taking care of my boyfriend, and creating magisk modules to complement android features that I feel can be improved
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, I'm gay and I have a boyfriend
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like Pokemon, I'm addicted to Pokemon Crystal Clear and the Minecraft Cubblemon mod and my favorite Pokemons are Meowscarada and Garchomp

### Which projects work for which functions?

The projects pinned to my profile are the ones I'm working on. If you want to use one of them but don't know which one, read this tip:

- If you want a specialized optimization for your processor, see perfd â€‹â€‹opt (if your processor uses schedutil as its main) or Project Wipe Work (if your processor uses interactive as its main). If you don't find your processor in the compatibility list, use Atlas.

- If you want additional optimizations, see the projects QoL, Basic Cleaner and qti-mem-opt.
