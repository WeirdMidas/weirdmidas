## Hi there 👋 I'm Weird Midas, a strange "Midas"

My name is The Weird Midas and my real name is **Davi Arthur da Silva**, many of my friends consider me self-taught because I just started my programming studies and I have great results.

# 🫠 About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Forks of old projects with the intention of making them better for current Android needs
- 🌱 I'm currently trying to learn how to master Android's EAS/HMP memory management and evolution
- 👽 Who am I? I'm a 1.80m tall colored cat of the "Puss in Boots" species, I have black and white eyes that look like precious stones... Hahaha, at least that's how I identify myself on the internet
- 👣 Where am I from? I'm Brazilian, I'm poor and I spend my time taking care of my boyfriend, and creating magisk modules to complement android features that I feel can be improved
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, I'm gay and I have a boyfriend
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like Pokemon, I'm addicted to Pokemon Crystal Clear and the Minecraft Cubblemon mod and my favorite Pokemons are Meowscarada and Garchomp
- 🥰 For those worried, I'm getting better. Even though my parents are in a mess because they're about to undergo a Venezuelan-style dictatorship, I'm also improving in other areas like mentality and health. I've finally managed to move forward with my projects, yeeeey.

### My career on github

### My main projects currently 🥱
- 🐦 [SkyScene](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/SkyScene-Addon) - A memory management module that aims to be modern and extract the maximum from lowmem (4GB or less) and high perf (6GB or more) devices. Pushing the limits of multitasking and energy efficiency at the same time.
- 🐣 [Perfd Opt](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/perfd-opt) - A CPU/GPU and EAS/HMP Scheduler module that seeks to extract the maximum from SOCs listed in compatibility in terms of efficiency, scheduling, and raw performance. Differentiating raw characteristics of processors such as those with big.LITTLE and DynamlQ architectures.
