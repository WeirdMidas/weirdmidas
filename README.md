## Hi there 👋 I'm Weird Midas, a strange "Midas"

My name is The Weird Midas and my real name is **Davi Arthur da Silva**, many friends and even my boyfriend consider me self-taught because of my ability to learn without anyone teaching me, which is how I learned to create modules like my **SkyScene**, **Atlas**, **ARTv3**, **Basic Cleaner** and my mainline projects: **XTU Add-on** & **Uperf**.

# 🫠 About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Forks of old projects with the intention of making them better for current Android needs
- 🌱 I am currently trying to learn to master the EAS/HMP scheduler and master the memory management of Android devices
- 👽 Who am I? I'm a 1.80m tall colored cat of the "Puss in Boots" species, I have black and white eyes that look like precious stones... Hahaha, at least that's how I identify myself on the internet
- 👣 Where am I from? I'm Brazilian, I'm poor and I spend my time taking care of my boyfriend, and creating magisk modules to complement android features that I feel can be improved
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, I'm gay and I have a boyfriend
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like Pokemon, I'm addicted to Pokemon Crystal Clear and the Minecraft Cubblemon mod and my favorite Pokemons are Meowscarada and Garchomp
- 🥰 For those worried, I'm getting better. Even though my parents are in a mess because they're about to undergo a Venezuelan-style dictatorship, I'm also improving in other areas like mentality and health. I've finally managed to move forward with my projects, yeeeey
  
### My career on github
[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=weirdmidas)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

### My main projects currently 🥱
- 🐦 [SkyScene](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/SkyScene-Addon) - A memory management module that seeks to extract maximum efficiency from kernel management and some software input, allowing for improved behavior in swapping, compaction, reclaim, mlocked, writeback, and other aspects that affect memory (such as storage) for better multitasking, efficiency, and overall device performance.
- 👾 About my two "mainline" projects - [perfd-opt](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/perfd-opt) and [Uperf](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/Uperf) are both forked projects designed to optimize CPU/GPU scheduling in very different ways. Uperf optimizes CPU scheduling through a custom scheduler, a type of scheduler that seeks to extract the maximum from the EAS scheduler and its custom governor **"SchedUser"**, which implements schedutil strategies to further align Uperf with EAS, allowing the EAS scheduler to be guided by Uperf. perfd-opt, on the other hand, is specifically designed for Snapdragon devices to optimize the behavior of the EAS/HMP scheduler, the Adreno GPU, the respective Schedutil/Interactive governors, and the Qti Boost Framework (if available for the SOC in question), pushing the **absolute limits between energy efficiency and performance without drawbacks**. Both are different scheduling optimization proposals, with different methodologies; both are still under construction, but if you want to show your support, give the repositories a star.
- Check out my side projects, like [ARTv3](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/ARTv3), a Magisk/KSU module that leverages ART properties to significantly improve app execution and runtime performance on Android devices. Also, [Basic Cleaner](https://github.com/WeirdMidas/BasicCleaner), a Magisk/KSU module that automates cleaning Android devices over time and updates important runtime binaries to their latest version (like SQLite).
